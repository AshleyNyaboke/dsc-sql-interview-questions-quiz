    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "SQLite uses five storage classes, but the four most common are NULL for no value, INTEGER for whole numbers, REAL for floating-point numbers, and TEXT for strings. The fifth, BLOB, stores binary data exactly as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common types – SQLite supports “type affinity,” meaning you can use common SQL types like VARCHAR, CHAR, BOOLEAN, or DATE. Internally, these are mapped to one of SQLite’s storage classes, so the database remains flexible while still accepting familiar SQL datatype names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A Primary Key (PK) is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, and it must be unique and never NULL. A Foreign Key (FK) is a column in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table, creating a link between the two tables.This relationship enforces referential integrity, ensuring that a foreign key value must match an existing primary key value. In short, the primary key acts as the parent identifier, and the foreign key acts as the child reference, allowing SQL databases to connect related data across tables and perform joins effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One-to-One (1:1) – Each row in one table is linked to exactly one row in another table, and vice versa. For example, a users table and a user_profiles table where each user has only one profile. This is often implemented by making a column both a primary key and a foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-Many (1:N) – A single row in one table can be linked to many rows in another table, but each row in the second table links back to only one row in the first table. For example, a customers table and an orders table where each customer can have multiple orders. This is implemented by placing a foreign key in the “many” side table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many (M:N) – Rows in one table can be linked to many rows in another table, and vice versa. For example, students and courses where each student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students. This requires a junction table (also called a bridge or link table) that stores pairs of foreign keys referencing both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "INNER JOIN – Returns only rows that have matching values in both tables. Rows without matches in either table are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there’s no match, the right table’s columns will be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there’s no match, the left table’s columns will be NULL (not directly supported in SQLite).\n",
    "\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN – Returns all rows from both tables. Matching rows are combined, and non-matching rows have NULL values for the missing side (not directly supported in SQLite).\n",
    "\n",
    "CROSS JOIN – Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables, pairing each row from the first table with every row from the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELF JOIN – Joins a table to itself, useful for hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions – Functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() that perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value. They are often used to summarize or analyze data.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY – A clause that groups rows sharing the same value in specified columns into summary rows, allowing aggregate functions to be applied to each group separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship – Aggregate functions work with GROUP BY to produce summaries per group instead of for the whole table. Without GROUP BY, an aggregate function returns a single result for all rows; with GROUP BY, it returns one result for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Associative entities (also called join tables, bridge tables, or junction tables) act as a link between two tables that have a many-to-many relationship. In a many-to-many setup, each row in Table A can relate to multiple rows in Table B, and vice versa. Since SQL tables can’t directly represent many-to-many relationships, an associative entity is created to store the pairs of keys that connect them. This table contains at least two foreign keys — one referencing the primary key of Table A and one referencing the primary key of Table B — and may also store extra information about the relationship. During a JOIN, the associative entity serves as the middle table that allows data from both main tables to be combined accurately.\n",
